# Projectionist Elm

Simple plugin that uses
[vim-projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist) to let
commands like `:A`, `:AS`, `:AV`, etc to jump between the test and the
implementation file and vice versa.

## Installation

### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)


```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-projectionist'
Plug 'Tranquility/vim-projectionist-elm'
```
